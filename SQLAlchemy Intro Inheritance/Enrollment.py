    # You'll notice that the elements in the two lists for the foreign key constraint are

    # for each of the primary key attributes migrating down from the parent.  But we
    # cannot do that here because that would require that we import Section from Section
    # here in Enrollments.  That, in turn, would cause a cyclic import since we have to
    # import Enrollment in Section so that adding a student to a Section can create an
    # instance of Enrollment using Enrollment's constructor.

    # table column names, that worked.  Not sure what the deep reason for that is.
